# Module 04: Global Health

## Introduction

Global health represents one of humanity's greatest challenges and opportunities—the chance to create a world where every person, regardless of where they are born, has the opportunity to live a healthy and fulfilling life. Yet our current global health systems are marked by profound inequalities, with billions lacking access to basic healthcare while others receive the most advanced treatments available.

Global health is not simply about extending medical care to more people, but about transforming the conditions that create health or disease on a planetary scale. It requires addressing the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health while building health systems that are community-controlled, culturally responsive, and oriented toward prevention and wellness rather than profit and treatment.

This module explores comprehensive approaches to global health that prioritize health equity, community empowerment, and planetary well-being. It demonstrates how health can become a foundation for global cooperation, social justice, and environmental sustainability rather than a source of inequality and exploitation.

## Vision for Global Health

### Health as Universal Human Right

Global health begins with the recognition that health is a fundamental human right that belongs to all people regardless of nationality, race, gender, economic status, or any other characteristic. This means creating health systems that serve people rather than profit, that address root causes rather than just symptoms, and that build community capacity rather than dependence.

A rights-based approach to global health requires:
- **Universal access** to quality healthcare for all people
- **Community control** over health systems and resources
- **Cultural responsiveness** that honors diverse healing traditions
- **Environmental sustainability** that protects planetary health
- **Social justice** that addresses inequalities and discrimination

### Planetary Health and One Health

Global health is inseparable from planetary health—the health of human civilization and the natural systems on which it depends. Climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and ecosystem degradation are among the greatest threats to human health, while human activities are the primary drivers of environmental destruction.

A planetary health approach recognizes that:
- **Human health depends on healthy ecosystems** and stable climate
- **Environmental degradation disproportionately affects** the most vulnerable populations
- **Health systems must become environmentally sustainable** and climate-resilient
- **Traditional ecological knowledge** offers important insights for planetary health
- **Global cooperation** is essential for addressing planetary health challenges

### Community-Centered Global Health

Effective global health initiatives are community-centered, building on community assets and priorities rather than imposing external solutions. This means supporting community health workers, traditional healers, and community organizations while ensuring that communities have control over health programs and resources.

Community-centered global health emphasizes:
- **Community ownership** of health programs and initiatives
- **Local knowledge** and traditional healing practices
- **Community capacity building** and leadership development
- **Cultural responsiveness** and linguistic accessibility
- **Community organizing** for health equity and justice

## Key Themes and Approaches

### Health Equity and Social Justice

Global health must address the root causes of health inequalities, including poverty, discrimination, environmental degradation, and lack of access to basic needs. This requires understanding health as a social justice issue and building movements for health equity that challenge systems of oppression and exploitation.

Health equity approaches include:
- **Addressing social determinants** of health including housing, education, and economic security
- **Challenging structural racism** and other forms of discrimination in health systems
- **Building community power** to advocate for health equity and justice
- **Supporting community organizing** for health policy change
- **Creating accountability mechanisms** for health equity outcomes

### Decolonizing Global Health

Much of global health has been shaped by colonial relationships that extract resources and knowledge from the Global South while concentrating power and benefits in the Global North. Decolonizing global health means transforming these relationships to center community ownership, traditional knowledge, and equitable partnerships.

Decolonizing approaches include:
- **Community ownership** and control of health programs and resources
- **Traditional knowledge** recognition and protection
- **Equitable partnerships** that share power and resources
- **Local capacity building** rather than dependence on external experts
- **Reparative justice** that addresses historical harms and inequalities

### Planetary Health and Climate Justice

Climate change is one of the greatest threats to global health, with impacts including extreme weather, food and water insecurity, infectious disease spread, and displacement. Climate impacts disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations while those least responsible for emissions suffer the greatest consequences.

Climate and health approaches include:
- **Climate-resilient health systems** that can adapt to changing conditions
- **Community-based adaptation** that builds on local knowledge and capacity
- **Health co-benefits** of climate action including cleaner air and active transportation
- **Climate justice** that addresses inequitable impacts and responsibilities
- **Global cooperation** for climate action and health protection

### Traditional Medicine and Healing Systems

Traditional medicine and healing systems represent thousands of years of accumulated knowledge about health and healing, yet they are often marginalized or appropriated by dominant medical systems. Integrating traditional medicine means recognizing its value while ensuring community control over traditional knowledge.

Traditional medicine approaches include:
- **Community control** over traditional medicine knowledge and practices
- **Integration** with modern medicine where appropriate and desired
- **Research and documentation** led by traditional knowledge holders
- **Protection** of traditional knowledge from appropriation and exploitation
- **Training and education** that honors traditional healing practices
