# Health Equity and Justice

## Introduction

Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This requires removing obstacles to health such as poverty, discrimination, and their consequences, including powerlessness and lack of access to good jobs with fair pay, quality education and housing, safe environments, and healthcare. Yet across the world, profound health inequalities persist both between and within countries, with the poorest and most marginalized populations bearing the greatest burden of disease and death.

Health justice goes beyond equity to address the root causes of health inequalities and build community power to create conditions for health and well-being. It recognizes that health is not just a medical issue but a social justice issue that requires transforming the systems and structures that create and maintain health inequalities.

This document explores the principles and frameworks for advancing health equity and justice globally, emphasizing community empowerment, structural change, and the recognition of health as a fundamental human right that requires collective action to achieve.

## Understanding Health Inequalities

### Global Health Disparities

Health inequalities exist at every level—between countries, within countries, and between different population groups. These disparities are not natural or inevitable but are the result of social, economic, and political systems that distribute resources, opportunities, and power unequally.

**Between-Country Inequalities**
- Life expectancy varies by more than 30 years between countries
- Maternal mortality rates are 100 times higher in some countries than others
- Child mortality rates vary dramatically based on country of birth
- Access to essential medicines and vaccines remains highly unequal
- Health system capacity and quality vary enormously between countries

**Within-Country Inequalities**
- Significant health disparities exist within all countries, including the wealthiest
- Indigenous populations face worse health outcomes in virtually every country
- Racial and ethnic minorities experience systematic health disadvantages
- Rural populations often have limited access to healthcare and worse health outcomes
- Urban slum dwellers face multiple health risks and limited access to services

**Social Determinants of Health Inequalities**
- Income and wealth inequality strongly predict health outcomes
- Education levels correlate with health status and life expectancy
- Housing quality and neighborhood conditions affect health
- Employment conditions and job security impact physical and mental health
- Social exclusion and discrimination create chronic stress and poor health

### Structural Racism and Health

Racism is a fundamental cause of health inequalities, operating through multiple pathways to create and maintain health disparities. Structural racism refers to the ways that racist ideologies and practices are embedded in social institutions and systems, creating systematic disadvantages for racialized groups.

**Historical and Ongoing Colonialism**
- Colonial extraction of resources and wealth created global inequalities that persist today
- Colonial medical systems displaced traditional healing practices and knowledge
- Ongoing neocolonial relationships maintain health inequalities between Global North and South
- Land dispossession and cultural destruction continue to impact Indigenous health
- Slavery and its legacies created intergenerational health disadvantages

**Contemporary Structural Racism**
- Discriminatory policies in housing, education, and employment create health inequalities
- Environmental racism concentrates pollution and health hazards in communities of color
- Healthcare systems perpetuate racial bias in diagnosis, treatment, and care quality
- Criminal justice systems criminalize communities of color, creating health harms
- Immigration policies create barriers to healthcare access and health security

**Intersectionality and Multiple Oppressions**
- Health inequalities are shaped by multiple intersecting identities and oppressions
- Women of color face unique health challenges related to both racism and sexism
- LGBTQ+ people of color experience discrimination in healthcare and society
- People with disabilities face additional barriers to healthcare and health equity
- Class, immigration status, and other factors compound racial health inequalities

### Gender and Health Inequalities

Gender inequalities profoundly shape health outcomes, with women and gender minorities facing systematic disadvantages in health systems and society. These inequalities are rooted in patriarchal systems that devalue women and limit their power and autonomy.

**Women's Health Inequalities**
- Maternal mortality remains unacceptably high, particularly in low-income countries
- Women face barriers to reproductive healthcare and family planning services
- Gender-based violence creates significant physical and mental health harms
- Women's unpaid care work is undervalued and creates health risks
- Women face discrimination and bias in healthcare diagnosis and treatment

**Gender Minorities and Health**
- Transgender and gender non-conforming people face discrimination in healthcare
- Lack of culturally competent care creates barriers to healthcare access
- Mental health impacts of discrimination and marginalization are significant
- Legal and social recognition affects access to healthcare and social services
- Violence and harassment create ongoing health risks and trauma

**Reproductive Justice**
- Reproductive justice encompasses the right to have children, not have children, and parent in safe and healthy environments
- Access to contraception, abortion, and maternal healthcare varies dramatically globally
- Forced sterilization and reproductive coercion continue to affect marginalized women
- Environmental health threats disproportionately affect reproductive health
- Economic inequality limits reproductive choices and parenting opportunities

## Health as Human Right

### Legal and Ethical Foundations

The right to health is recognized in international human rights law as a fundamental right that belongs to all people. This right encompasses not only access to healthcare but also the underlying determinants of health including safe water, adequate sanitation, safe food, adequate housing, healthy working conditions, and a healthy environment.

**International Human Rights Framework**
- Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 25) recognizes health as component of adequate standard of living
- International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Article 12) establishes right to highest attainable standard of health
- Convention on Rights of Child (Article 24) establishes children's right to health
- Convention on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women ensures equal health rights
- Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities ensures inclusive healthcare

**Core Elements of Right to Health**
- **Availability**: Sufficient healthcare facilities, goods, and services for all
- **Accessibility**: Healthcare accessible to all without discrimination, physically and economically
- **Acceptability**: Healthcare respectful of medical ethics and culturally appropriate
- **Quality**: Healthcare that is scientifically and medically appropriate and of good quality
- **Non-discrimination**: Equal access to healthcare regardless of race, gender, disability, or other status

**State Obligations and Accountability**
- **Respect**: States must not interfere with enjoyment of right to health
- **Protect**: States must prevent third parties from violating right to health
- **Fulfill**: States must take positive steps to realize right to health
- **Progressive realization**: States must continuously improve health conditions
- **International cooperation**: Wealthy countries must assist poorer countries in realizing right to health

### Community Empowerment and Health Rights

Realizing the right to health requires community empowerment and participation in health decision-making. Communities must have the power to define their own health priorities, control health resources, and hold health systems accountable to their needs.

**Community Participation and Control**
- Meaningful participation in health planning and decision-making
- Community ownership and governance of health programs and facilities

- Integration of traditional and modern medicine where appropriate
- Community-controlled research on traditional medicine effectiveness
- Protection from biopiracy and appropriation of traditional knowledge

## Social Determinants of Health

### Addressing Root Causes

Health is created in the places where people live, work, learn, and play. The social determinants of health—the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age—have a greater impact on health outcomes than medical care. Addressing health inequalities requires transforming these social determinants.

**Economic Determinants**
- Income and wealth inequality strongly predict health outcomes

- Community economic development can improve health outcomes and reduce inequalities

**Social and Political Determinants**
- Social cohesion and community connections protect health and well-being
- Political participation and democratic governance improve population health
- Social exclusion and discrimination create chronic stress and poor health
- Community organizing and social movements can improve health outcomes
- Policy decisions about resource allocation profoundly affect health

**Environmental Determinants**
- Environmental quality including air, water, and soil affects health outcomes
- Climate change creates multiple health risks including extreme weather and infectious disease

*"Health equity is the absence of unfair and avoidable or remediable differences in health among population groups defined socially, economically, demographically or geographically." — World Health Organization*

*Applied to health justice: Health equity becomes health justice when communities have the power to eliminate unfair health differences through organizing, advocacy, and systemic change that addresses root causes and builds community control over the conditions that create health.*
