# Planetary Health and Sustainability

## Introduction

Planetary health is the health of human civilization and the natural systems on which it depends. It recognizes that human health is fundamentally interconnected with the health of the planet—that we cannot have healthy people on a sick planet, and that the environmental crises we face today are also health crises that threaten the well-being of current and future generations.

The concept of planetary health emerged from the recognition that the dominant model of development has created unprecedented prosperity for some while simultaneously degrading the Earth's life-support systems and creating massive health inequalities. Climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and ecosystem degradation are among the greatest threats to human health, while human activities are the primary drivers of environmental destruction.

This document explores the principles and frameworks for advancing planetary health and sustainability, emphasizing the interconnections between human and environmental health, the need for transformative change in how we live and organize society, and the importance of community-controlled approaches that build on traditional ecological knowledge and environmental justice.

## Understanding Planetary Health

### The Anthropocene and Health

We are living in the Anthropocene—a new geological epoch defined by human impact on Earth's systems. Human activities have altered the planet's climate, chemistry, and biology to such an extent that we have crossed several planetary boundaries that define the safe operating space for humanity.

**Planetary Boundaries and Health**
- **Climate change**: Rising temperatures, extreme weather, and sea level rise threaten health through heat stress, natural disasters, food and water insecurity, and infectious disease spread
- **Biodiversity loss**: Ecosystem degradation reduces nature's capacity to regulate disease, provide clean air and water, and support food systems
- **Nitrogen and phosphorus cycles**: Pollution from fertilizers creates dead zones in water bodies and contributes to climate change
- **Ocean acidification**: Changes in ocean chemistry threaten marine food systems and coastal communities
- **Land use change**: Deforestation and habitat destruction increase zoonotic disease risk and reduce ecosystem services

**Health Impacts of Environmental Degradation**
- Air pollution causes millions of premature deaths annually and contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular disease
- Water pollution and scarcity affect billions of people and cause waterborne diseases
- Soil degradation threatens food security and nutrition
- Chemical pollution creates cancer clusters and developmental disorders
- Noise pollution affects mental health and cognitive development

**Environmental Justice and Health**
- Environmental hazards disproportionately affect poor communities and communities of color
- Indigenous peoples face particular threats from extractive industries and land grabbing
- Women and children are often most vulnerable to environmental health risks
- Climate change impacts are most severe for those least responsible for emissions
- Environmental racism concentrates pollution and health hazards in marginalized communities

### Climate Change and Health

Climate change is perhaps the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century, with impacts that are already being felt around the world and that will intensify without rapid action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience.

**Direct Health Impacts**
- **Heat-related illness**: Rising temperatures increase heat stress, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke
- **Extreme weather**: More frequent and severe storms, floods, droughts, and wildfires cause injuries, deaths, and mental health impacts
- **Air quality**: Higher temperatures worsen air pollution and increase respiratory disease
- **UV exposure**: Ozone depletion increases skin cancer and eye disease risk
- **Natural disasters**: Climate-related disasters cause immediate health impacts and long-term trauma

**Indirect Health Impacts**
- **Food security**: Changing precipitation and temperature patterns threaten crop yields and food systems
- **Water security**: Droughts, floods, and changing precipitation affect water availability and quality
- **Infectious diseases**: Changing temperature and precipitation patterns affect disease vector distribution and disease transmission
- **Displacement and migration**: Climate impacts force people to leave their homes, creating health risks and social disruption
- **Conflict and violence**: Resource scarcity and environmental stress contribute to conflict and violence

**Health System Impacts**
- Climate change threatens health system infrastructure and capacity
- Extreme weather events can damage hospitals and clinics
- Changing disease patterns require health system adaptation
- Climate impacts on health workers and supply chains affect service delivery
- Health systems contribute to climate change through energy use and waste

### One Health and Ecosystem Health

One Health is an approach that recognizes the interconnections between human, animal, and environmental health. It emphasizes the need for collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approaches to address health challenges that arise at the interface between humans, animals, and the environment.

**Zoonotic Disease Prevention**
- Most emerging infectious diseases originate in animals and are transmitted to humans
- Habitat destruction and wildlife trade increase zoonotic disease risk
- Factory farming and antibiotic use contribute to antimicrobial resistance
- Climate change affects disease vector distribution and disease transmission
- Community-based surveillance and prevention can reduce zoonotic disease risk

**Ecosystem Services and Health**
- Healthy ecosystems provide clean air and water, climate regulation, and disease control
- Forests and wetlands filter pollutants and regulate water flow
- Biodiversity supports food systems and provides medicines
- Green spaces in cities improve mental health and reduce air pollution
- Traditional ecological knowledge offers insights for ecosystem management

**Food Systems and Health**
- Industrial agriculture contributes to climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution
- Monocultures reduce resilience and increase pest and disease risk
- Pesticide use threatens human health and ecosystem health
- Sustainable agriculture can improve both human and environmental health
- Traditional food systems often support both cultural and ecological diversity

## Environmental Justice and Health

### Environmental Racism and Health Inequalities

Environmental racism refers to the disproportionate environmental burdens faced by communities of color, including exposure to pollution, toxic waste, and environmental hazards. This environmental injustice creates and perpetuates health inequalities.

**Historical and Ongoing Environmental Racism**
- Communities of color are more likely to live near polluting industries and waste facilities
- Environmental regulations are less likely to be enforced in communities of color

*"Planetary health is the health of human civilization and the state of the natural systems on which it depends." — The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on Planetary Health*

*Applied to planetary health: True planetary health means creating conditions where human health and environmental health are mutually reinforcing, where communities have control over their environmental conditions, and where health systems support rather than undermine the Earth's life-support systems.*
