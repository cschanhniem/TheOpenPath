# Healthcare for All

## Introduction

Health is not merely the absence of disease but a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. Yet across the world, billions of people lack access to basic healthcare services, while healthcare systems often prioritize profit over people and treatment over prevention. The COVID-19 pandemic starkly revealed the interconnectedness of individual and collective health, demonstrating that no one is truly healthy until everyone has access to healthcare.

Healthcare for All represents a fundamental shift from healthcare as a commodity to healthcare as a human right and public good. It means creating systems that keep people healthy rather than profiting from illness, that address the root causes of poor health rather than just treating symptoms, and that serve all people with dignity and respect regardless of their ability to pay.

This transformation requires moving beyond narrow biomedical models to embrace holistic approaches that recognize health as shaped by social, economic, and environmental conditions. It means building healthcare systems that are community-controlled, culturally responsive, and integrated with efforts to create healthy communities and environments.

## Understanding Health as a Human Right

### Legal and Ethical Foundations

**Core Elements of Right to Health**
- **Availability**: Sufficient quantity of functioning healthcare facilities, goods, and services
- **Accessibility**: Healthcare accessible to all without discrimination, physically and economically
- **Acceptability**: Healthcare respectful of medical ethics and culturally appropriate
- **Quality**: Healthcare scientifically and medically appropriate and of good quality
- **Non-discrimination**: Equal access regardless of race, gender, age, disability, or other status

**Health Equity Principles**
