# Economic Security and Opportunity

## Introduction

Economic security—the assurance that one can meet basic needs and maintain a decent standard of living—is fundamental to human dignity and well-being. Yet across the world, billions of people live in economic insecurity, struggling to afford housing, healthcare, education, and other necessities while working multiple jobs or facing unemployment. Meanwhile, wealth concentrates in the hands of a few while communities and ecosystems are depleted to generate profit.

Economic Security and Opportunity represents a transformative vision of economic systems that guarantee everyone's right to a livelihood while creating meaningful work that contributes to community well-being and ecological health. It means moving from extractive capitalism to regenerative economics that builds community wealth, supports human development, and enhances rather than degrades the conditions for life.

This transformation requires democratizing economic power so that workers and communities have control over their economic lives. It means creating economic systems based on cooperation, solidarity, and mutual aid rather than competition and exploitation. It means recognizing that true prosperity comes not from endless growth but from ensuring everyone has enough to thrive.

*"The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little." — Franklin D. Roosevelt*

*Applied to economic justice: True economic progress is not measured by GDP growth or stock market gains but by whether everyone has economic security and the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to their community's prosperity.*
