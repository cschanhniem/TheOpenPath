# Housing as Human Right

## Introduction

Housing is far more than shelterâ€”it is the foundation for human dignity, health, security, and opportunity. Yet across the world, over one billion people live in inadequate housing conditions, while millions more face homelessness, overcrowding, or the constant threat of eviction. The housing crisis is not a natural phenomenon but the result of treating housing as a commodity rather than recognizing it as a fundamental human right.

The right to adequate housing is enshrined in international human rights law, yet it remains one of the most violated rights globally. Creating a world where everyone has access to safe, affordable, and sustainable housing requires transforming how we think about, finance, and govern housing systems. It means moving from market-driven approaches that prioritize profit to human rights-based approaches that prioritize people and communities.

This document explores the principles, frameworks, and strategies for realizing housing as a human right, emphasizing community-centered approaches, sustainable design, and the creation of housing systems that enhance rather than extract from communities and ecosystems.

## Understanding Housing as a Human Right

*"Housing is a human right. There can be no justification in a society as rich as ours for the homeless to die in our streets." â€” Bernie Sanders*

*Applied to housing justice: Housing is not just a human right but the foundation for all other rightsâ€”when we ensure everyone has a safe, affordable, and sustainable home, we create the conditions for all people to thrive and contribute to their communities.*
