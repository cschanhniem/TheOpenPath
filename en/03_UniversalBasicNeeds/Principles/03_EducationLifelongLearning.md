# Education and Lifelong Learning

## Introduction

Education is the foundation of human development, democracy, and social progress. It is the key to unlocking human potential, building critical thinking skills, and creating informed citizens capable of participating fully in society. Yet across the world, hundreds of millions of children and adults lack access to quality education, while educational systems often perpetuate rather than challenge existing inequalities.

Education and Lifelong Learning represents a transformative vision of education as a human right and public good that serves all people throughout their lives. It means creating educational systems that develop the full potential of every learner, that are culturally responsive and community-controlled, and that prepare people not just for employment but for active citizenship and meaningful participation in democratic society.

This transformation requires moving beyond narrow, standardized approaches to embrace holistic, learner-centered education that integrates academic learning with social-emotional development, cultural knowledge, and practical skills. It means recognizing that learning happens everywhere and throughout life, and creating systems that support continuous growth and development for all people.
