# Digital Access and Inclusion

## Introduction

In the 21st century, digital access has become as essential as electricity, water, and transportation for full participation in society. The internet and digital technologies are not luxuries but fundamental infrastructure for accessing education, healthcare, employment, government services, and social connections. Yet billions of people worldwide lack access to reliable internet and digital devices, while others face barriers to meaningful digital participation due to cost, skills, language, or discrimination.

Digital Access and Inclusion represents a vision of technology as a public good that empowers communities and enhances human capabilities rather than concentrating power and wealth in the hands of a few corporations. It means ensuring that everyone has affordable access to high-quality internet and digital devices, the skills to use them effectively, and the power to shape how technology is developed and deployed in their communities.

This transformation requires moving from market-driven approaches that treat internet access as a commodity to human rights-based approaches that recognize digital access as essential infrastructure. It means democratizing technology so that communities have control over their digital futures and can use technology to strengthen rather than weaken social bonds and democratic participation.
