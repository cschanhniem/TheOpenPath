# Cooperative Economics and Solidarity Economy

## Introduction

The dominant economic system treats workers as costs to be minimized, communities as resources to be extracted, and the environment as an externality to be ignored. Cooperative economics and solidarity economy offer transformative alternatives that prioritize people and planet over profit, creating economic systems based on cooperation, mutual aid, and democratic ownership rather than competition and exploitation.

Cooperative economics encompasses various forms of democratic ownership and governance, from worker cooperatives and community land trusts to credit unions and platform cooperatives. Solidarity economy is a broader framework that includes cooperatives alongside other practices like gift economies, mutual aid networks, and community currencies that prioritize social and environmental well-being over capital accumulation.

This document explores comprehensive frameworks for building economic systems that serve communities rather than extracting from them, emphasizing democratic ownership, economic justice, and ecological sustainability. These models demonstrate how economics can become a foundation for community empowerment, environmental restoration, and social solidarity.

*"Another world is possible, and she is beautiful. I can hear her breathing." — Arundhati Roy*

*Applied to cooperative economics: Another economy is possible—one based on cooperation rather than competition, democracy rather than domination, and solidarity rather than exploitation. We can hear it breathing in every worker cooperative, community land trust, and mutual aid network.*
