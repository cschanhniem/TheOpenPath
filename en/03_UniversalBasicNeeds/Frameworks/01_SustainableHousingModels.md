# Sustainable Housing Models

## Introduction

Housing is one of humanity's most basic needs, yet conventional housing development often depletes natural resources, creates social segregation, and concentrates wealth in the hands of developers and landlords while leaving communities with debt and displacement. Sustainable housing models offer transformative alternatives that create homes while building community wealth, enhancing ecological health, and strengthening social bonds.

Sustainable housing goes beyond energy efficiency and green building materials to encompass the full lifecycle of housing development, from community-controlled planning and financing to cooperative ownership and democratic governance. These models demonstrate that housing can be a vehicle for community empowerment, environmental restoration, and social justice rather than extraction and exploitation.

This document explores comprehensive frameworks for developing housing that serves people and planet, emphasizing community ownership, ecological design, and affordability in perpetuity. These models show how housing can become a foundation for regenerative communities that enhance rather than degrade the conditions for life.
