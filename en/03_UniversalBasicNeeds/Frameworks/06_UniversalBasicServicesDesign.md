# Universal Basic Services Design

## Introduction

Universal Basic Services (UBS) represents a transformative approach to meeting human needs through the collective provision of essential services rather than relying on individual purchasing power in markets. While Universal Basic Income provides cash to individuals, Universal Basic Services provides the actual services and goods that people need—healthcare, education, housing, transportation, and digital access—as public goods available to all.

UBS recognizes that many essential needs are better met collectively than individually, creating economies of scale, reducing inequality, and building social solidarity. When designed with community participation and democratic governance, UBS can become a foundation for economic security, environmental sustainability, and social cohesion while reducing the commodification of basic needs.

This document explores comprehensive frameworks for designing and implementing universal basic services that are community-controlled, environmentally sustainable, and oriented toward human flourishing rather than profit maximization. These models demonstrate how public goods can become a foundation for community empowerment and collective well-being.
