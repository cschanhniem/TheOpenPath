# Technology for Social Good

## Introduction

Technology has immense potential to enhance human capabilities, strengthen communities, and address social challenges, yet the dominant model of technology development prioritizes corporate profit over social benefit, concentrates power in the hands of a few tech giants, and often exacerbates rather than reduces inequality and social problems. Technology for social good represents a transformative approach that puts community needs and democratic values at the center of technology development and deployment.

Technology for social good encompasses both the development of technologies specifically designed to address social challenges and the democratic governance of all technology to ensure it serves community needs rather than extracting from communities. This includes everything from community-owned broadband networks and platform cooperatives to open-source software and participatory technology design.

This document explores frameworks for developing and governing technology that empowers communities, strengthens democracy, and enhances rather than undermines human dignity and social solidarity. These models demonstrate how technology can become a foundation for community empowerment and collective well-being rather than surveillance and control.

*"Technology is not neutral. We're inside of what we make, and it's inside of us. We're living in a world of connections—and it matters which ones get made and unmade." — Donna Haraway*

*Applied to technology for social good: Technology becomes a force for liberation when communities have democratic control over its development and governance, when it strengthens rather than weakens social bonds, and when it serves human flourishing rather than corporate profit.*
