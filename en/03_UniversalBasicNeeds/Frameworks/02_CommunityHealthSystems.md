# Community Health Systems

## Introduction

Health is created in communities—in the places where people live, work, learn, and play. While medical care is important for treating illness, the conditions that create health or disease are largely determined by social, economic, and environmental factors in communities. Community health systems recognize this reality and work to address the root causes of poor health while building community capacity to create conditions for wellness and thriving.

Community health systems go beyond traditional healthcare delivery to encompass comprehensive approaches that integrate medical care with social services, community development, and environmental health. These systems are community-controlled, culturally responsive, and focused on prevention and health promotion rather than just treatment of disease.

This document explores frameworks for building health systems that serve whole communities, emphasizing community ownership, prevention and wellness, and the integration of health with social justice and environmental sustainability. These models demonstrate how healthcare can become a foundation for community empowerment and collective well-being.
