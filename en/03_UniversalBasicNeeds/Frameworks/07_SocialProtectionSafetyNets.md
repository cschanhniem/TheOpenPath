# Social Protection and Safety Nets

## Introduction

Social protection systems are the foundation of economic security and human dignity, providing support when people face unemployment, illness, disability, old age, or other life challenges that threaten their ability to meet basic needs. Yet many existing safety net programs are inadequate, punitive, and designed to maintain rather than challenge economic inequality and social exclusion.

Comprehensive social protection represents a transformative approach that guarantees economic security as a human right while building community resilience and solidarity. These systems go beyond temporary assistance to provide universal coverage that enables all people to live with dignity and participate fully in society, regardless of their employment status or life circumstances.

This document explores frameworks for creating social protection systems that are universal, adequate, and empoweringâ€”systems that strengthen rather than stigmatize communities while building the foundation for economic democracy and social justice. These models demonstrate how social protection can become a foundation for community empowerment and collective well-being.
