# Water Purification Technologies

## Introduction

Access to clean water is fundamental to human health and well-being. Yet millions of people worldwide lack reliable access to safe drinking water, leading to preventable disease, lost productivity, and diminished quality of life. Open source water purification technologies offer accessible, adaptable solutions that can be implemented in diverse contexts with locally available materials and knowledge.

This document explores a range of water purification technologies that can be freely built, modified, and shared. These approaches range from simple, low-cost methods suitable for household use to more complex systems for community-scale implementation. Each technology is presented with practical guidance for implementation, adaptation to local conditions, and long-term maintenance.
