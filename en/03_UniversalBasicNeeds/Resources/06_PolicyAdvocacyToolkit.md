# Policy and Advocacy Toolkit

## Introduction

Creating systemic change to ensure universal basic needs requires comprehensive policy advocacy that combines community organizing, policy development, and strategic campaigns to transform the systems that determine whether people can meet their basic needs. Policy advocacy goes beyond individual service provision to address the root causes of inequality and create structural changes that benefit entire communities.

This document provides practical tools and resources for policy analysis, community organizing for policy change, policy development and advocacy, and building movements for systemic transformation. These resources are designed to support community-controlled advocacy that builds community power while advancing policies that serve community needs rather than corporate interests.

The tools presented here recognize that effective policy advocacy requires community organizing, democratic participation, and long-term movement building to create the political conditions necessary for transformative policy change.
