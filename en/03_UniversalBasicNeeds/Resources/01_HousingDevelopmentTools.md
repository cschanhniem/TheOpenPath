# Housing Development Tools

## Introduction

Developing affordable, sustainable, and community-controlled housing requires access to practical tools, resources, and guidance that can help communities navigate the complex process of housing development. From initial community organizing and needs assessment through financing, design, construction, and long-term stewardship, communities need comprehensive resources that support democratic participation and community ownership.

This document provides a comprehensive toolkit for community-controlled housing development, emphasizing tools that support community land trusts, housing cooperatives, and other forms of community ownership. These resources are designed to be accessible to communities with varying levels of technical expertise while maintaining high standards for sustainability, affordability, and community empowerment.

The tools presented here recognize that housing development is not just a technical process but a community development process that builds local capacity, creates economic opportunity, and strengthens social bonds while creating homes that serve people and planet.
