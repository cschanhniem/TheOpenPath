# Economic Development Resources

## Introduction

Building community-controlled economic development requires comprehensive resources that support cooperative enterprise development, community wealth building, and democratic economic planning. Community economic development goes beyond attracting outside investment to creating locally-owned enterprises, keeping wealth circulating in communities, and building economic systems that serve community needs rather than extracting from communities.

This document provides practical tools and resources for cooperative development, community development finance, community economic planning, and community organizing for economic justice. These resources are designed to support community ownership and control of economic development while building local capacity and creating economic opportunity that serves community priorities.

The tools presented here recognize that economic development is most effective when it is community-controlled, democratically governed, and oriented toward building community wealth and power rather than individual accumulation and external extraction.
