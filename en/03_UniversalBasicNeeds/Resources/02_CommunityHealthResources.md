# Community Health Resources

## Introduction

Building healthy communities requires comprehensive resources that support community-controlled health assessment, planning, and program development. Community health goes beyond individual medical care to address the social, economic, and environmental conditions that determine whether people can be healthy and thrive in their communities.

This document provides practical tools and resources for community health assessment, community health center development, community health worker programs, and community organizing for health equity. These resources are designed to support community ownership and control of health initiatives while building local capacity and addressing root causes of poor health.

The tools presented here recognize that health is created in communities through collective action, community control, and addressing the social determinants of health including housing, education, employment, food security, and environmental conditions.
