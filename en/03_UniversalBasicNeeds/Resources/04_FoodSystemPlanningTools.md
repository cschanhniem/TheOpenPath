# Food System Planning Tools

## Introduction

Building sustainable, equitable, and community-controlled food systems requires comprehensive planning tools that support community assessment, visioning, and implementation of local food initiatives. Food system planning goes beyond individual projects to create integrated networks of food production, processing, distribution, and consumption that serve community needs while building local capacity and economic opportunity.

This document provides practical tools and resources for community food system assessment, food policy development, local food enterprise development, and community organizing for food justice. These resources are designed to support community ownership and control of food systems while building food sovereignty and community resilience.

The tools presented here recognize that food systems are complex networks that connect land, labor, culture, and community, and that effective food system planning requires community participation, cultural responsiveness, and attention to social justice and environmental sustainability.
