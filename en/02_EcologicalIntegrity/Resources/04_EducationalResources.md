# Educational Resources

## Introduction

Education is the foundation of all lasting change. To create a world where human communities and natural systems thrive together, we must transform how we learn about our relationship with the Earth and each other. This transformation requires moving beyond traditional environmental education to embrace regenerative learning approaches that integrate ecological literacy, systems thinking, and action-oriented learning.

Regenerative education recognizes that learning happens everywhere—in schools, communities, workplaces, and through direct experience with nature. It emphasizes experiential learning, place-based education, and the integration of multiple ways of knowing, including Indigenous wisdom, scientific knowledge, and community experience.

This comprehensive guide provides educational resources and approaches for learners of all ages, from early childhood through adult education, offering pathways for developing the knowledge, skills, and values needed to create regenerative communities and sustainable futures.
