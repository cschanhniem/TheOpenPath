# Research and Evidence Base

## Introduction

The transition to ecological integrity and regenerative systems is supported by a growing body of scientific research, empirical evidence, and practical demonstrations from around the world. This evidence base spans multiple disciplines—from ecology and climate science to economics and social psychology—providing robust foundations for the principles and practices outlined in this module.

Understanding and communicating this evidence is crucial for building support for regenerative approaches, informing policy decisions, and guiding implementation efforts. This document synthesizes key research findings, identifies emerging trends, and provides guidance for accessing and evaluating scientific evidence related to ecological integrity and regenerative development.
