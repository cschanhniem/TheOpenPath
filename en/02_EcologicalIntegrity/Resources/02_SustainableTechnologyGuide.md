# Sustainable Technology Guide

## Introduction

Technology has the potential to be either humanity's greatest tool for regenerating our planet or its most destructive force. The choice depends on how we design, deploy, and govern technological systems. Sustainable technology represents a fundamental shift from technologies that extract and deplete to those that enhance and regenerate the conditions for life.

Sustainable technology is not just about clean energy or electric vehiclesâ€”it encompasses a holistic approach to innovation that considers the full lifecycle impacts of technologies, their social and environmental consequences, and their role in creating just and regenerative systems.
