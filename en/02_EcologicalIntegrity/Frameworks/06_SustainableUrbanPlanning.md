# Sustainable Urban Planning

## Introduction

Cities are home to more than half of the world's population and are responsible for approximately 70% of global carbon emissions. As urbanization continues to accelerate, the way we plan, design, and manage cities will largely determine humanity's environmental future. Sustainable urban planning offers a pathway to create cities that enhance rather than degrade ecological systems while providing healthy, equitable, and prosperous communities for all residents.

Sustainable urban planning integrates environmental, social, and economic considerations to create cities that work within planetary boundaries while meeting human needs. It recognizes cities as complex socio-ecological systems that can be designed to regenerate natural systems, build community resilience, and create conditions for all life to flourish.

This document provides comprehensive guidance for sustainable urban planning, from principles and strategies to implementation tools and case studies, offering a framework for creating regenerative cities that serve as models for sustainable development worldwide.
