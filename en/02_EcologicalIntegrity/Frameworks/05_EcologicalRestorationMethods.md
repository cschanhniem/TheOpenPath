# Ecological Restoration Methods

## Introduction

Ecological restoration is the process of assisting the recovery of ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed. It represents humanity's opportunity to heal the wounds we have inflicted on the natural world while creating resilient landscapes that can support both human communities and biodiversity for generations to come.

Restoration goes beyond simply planting trees or removing invasive species—it requires understanding complex ecological relationships, natural processes, and the historical context of landscapes. Successful restoration recreates the structure, function, and dynamics of natural ecosystems while adapting to current and future environmental conditions.

This document provides comprehensive guidance on ecological restoration methods, from planning and implementation to monitoring and adaptive management, offering pathways for healing damaged ecosystems and creating regenerative landscapes.

## Principles of Ecological Restoration

### Understanding Reference Ecosystems

**Historical Baselines**

*"We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect." — Aldo Leopold*

*Applied to restoration: We restore ecosystems not because we own them, but because we belong to them—healing the land heals ourselves and creates the foundation for all life to flourish.*
