# Indigenous Wisdom Integration

## Introduction

Indigenous peoples represent less than 5% of the global population yet protect 80% of the world's biodiversity. For thousands of years, Indigenous communities have developed sophisticated knowledge systems, governance structures, and practices that enable them to live in sustainable relationship with their environments. This traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) offers profound insights for addressing contemporary environmental and social challenges.

Indigenous wisdom encompasses far more than environmental knowledge—it includes holistic worldviews, governance systems, healing practices, and ways of being that prioritize the well-being of all life across multiple generations. As humanity faces unprecedented ecological and social crises, learning from and respectfully integrating Indigenous wisdom has become essential for creating regenerative and just futures.

This document explores principles and practices for respectfully integrating Indigenous wisdom into contemporary sustainability efforts, emphasizing the importance of Indigenous rights, sovereignty, and leadership while offering guidance for non-Indigenous people and organizations seeking to learn from Indigenous knowledge systems.
