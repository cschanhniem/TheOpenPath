# Circular Economy Models

## Introduction

The circular economy represents a fundamental shift from the linear "take-make-dispose" model that has dominated industrial production for centuries. Instead of extracting resources, manufacturing products, and discarding waste, the circular economy is designed to eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials at their highest value, and regenerate natural systems.

This regenerative approach mimics natural ecosystems where nothing is wastedâ€”the output of one process becomes the input for another, creating closed loops that sustain themselves indefinitely. By applying these principles to human economic systems, we can create prosperity while staying within planetary boundaries and enhancing rather than degrading the natural world.

This document explores the principles, strategies, and applications of circular economy models, providing a comprehensive framework for designing economic systems that work in harmony with ecological systems.
