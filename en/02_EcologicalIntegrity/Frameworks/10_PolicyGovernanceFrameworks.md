# Policy and Governance Frameworks

## Introduction

Achieving ecological integrity and regenerative development requires fundamental changes in how we govern ourselves and make collective decisions. Current governance systems, designed for a different era, often prioritize short-term economic gains over long-term ecological and social well-being. Creating a sustainable and just future demands new policy frameworks and governance approaches that can address complex, interconnected challenges while ensuring democratic participation and accountability.

Regenerative governance recognizes that human societies are embedded within larger ecological and social systems, and that our governance structures must reflect this reality. It emphasizes collaboration, inclusion, long-term thinking, and the integration of diverse knowledge systems to create policies that enhance rather than degrade the conditions for life.

This document explores innovative policy and governance frameworks that can support ecological integrity and regenerative development, from local to global scales, providing guidance for creating governance systems that serve both people and planet.
