# Community Resilience Building

## Introduction

Community resilience is the ability of a community to prepare for, respond to, recover from, and adapt to adverse events while maintaining essential functions and thriving in the face of change. In an era of increasing environmental, social, and economic uncertainty, building community resilience has become essential for creating sustainable and flourishing communities.

Resilient communities are not just able to bounce back from disruptionsâ€”they have the capacity to transform and emerge stronger, more equitable, and more sustainable. They possess diverse assets, strong social networks, adaptive governance systems, and the ability to learn and innovate in response to challenges.

This document provides a comprehensive framework for building community resilience, exploring the principles, strategies, and practices that enable communities to thrive in the face of uncertainty while creating conditions for all community members to flourish.
