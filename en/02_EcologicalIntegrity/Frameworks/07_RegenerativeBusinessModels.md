# Regenerative Business Models

## Introduction

Business has the potential to be one of the most powerful forces for regenerating our planet and creating conditions for all life to thrive. However, the dominant business paradigm of maximizing shareholder value while externalizing environmental and social costs has contributed to many of the crises we face today. Regenerative business models offer a fundamental reimagining of the purpose and practice of businessâ€”creating enterprises that enhance rather than degrade the living systems of which they are part.

Regenerative business goes beyond sustainability and corporate social responsibility to actively contribute to the health and vitality of social and ecological systems. These businesses recognize that their long-term success depends on the health of the communities and ecosystems they operate within, and they design their operations to create positive impacts across all stakeholders.

This document explores the principles, strategies, and practices of regenerative business models, providing a comprehensive framework for creating enterprises that serve life and generate prosperity for all.
