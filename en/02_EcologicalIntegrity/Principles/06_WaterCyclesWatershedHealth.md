# Water Cycles and Watershed Health

## Introduction

Water is the foundation of all life on Earth. It flows through every living cell, shapes landscapes, drives weather patterns, and connects all ecosystems across the planet. The water cycle—the continuous movement of water through the atmosphere, land, and oceans—is one of Earth's most fundamental processes, essential for maintaining the conditions that support life.

Watersheds are the natural units through which water moves across the landscape, connecting mountains to seas, forests to rivers, and communities to the broader web of life. Healthy watersheds provide clean water, regulate floods and droughts, support biodiversity, and sustain human communities. However, human activities have disrupted water cycles and degraded watersheds worldwide, threatening both ecological integrity and human well-being.

This document explores the science of water cycles and watershed systems, the challenges facing water resources globally, and pathways toward restoring and maintaining watershed health for the benefit of all life.

## Understanding the Water Cycle

### The Global Water Cycle

**Water Reservoirs**
- **Oceans**: 97.5% of Earth's water, saltwater
- **Ice caps and glaciers**: 1.7% of Earth's water, mostly frozen fresh water
- **Groundwater**: 0.7% of Earth's water, underground fresh water
- **Surface water**: 0.01% of Earth's water, rivers, lakes, and wetlands
- **Atmosphere**: 0.001% of Earth's water, water vapor and clouds
- **Biosphere**: Tiny fraction but essential for all life

**Water Cycle Processes**
- **Evaporation**: Water changes from liquid to vapor, primarily from oceans
- **Transpiration**: Plants release water vapor through their leaves
- **Evapotranspiration**: Combined evaporation and transpiration
- **Condensation**: Water vapor forms clouds and fog
- **Precipitation**: Water falls as rain, snow, sleet, or hail
- **Infiltration**: Water soaks into soil and becomes groundwater
- **Runoff**: Water flows over land surface to streams and rivers

**Energy and the Water Cycle**
- Solar energy drives evaporation and atmospheric circulation
- Latent heat released during condensation powers weather systems
- Water cycle transports energy around the globe
- Climate change affects water cycle energy balance
- Vegetation influences local energy and water balance

### Regional Water Cycles

**Atmospheric Rivers**
- Narrow corridors of concentrated water vapor in atmosphere
- Transport water from tropical to temperate regions
