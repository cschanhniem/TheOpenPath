# Soil Health and Food Systems

## Introduction

Soil is the foundation of terrestrial life—a living, breathing ecosystem that supports nearly all food production and countless ecological processes. Often called "the skin of the Earth," soil is home to more biodiversity than any other ecosystem, containing billions of microorganisms in every gram. Healthy soils store carbon, filter water, cycle nutrients, and provide the foundation for resilient food systems.

Yet soil is one of our most threatened resources. Industrial agriculture, deforestation, and development have degraded soils worldwide, leading to erosion, loss of organic matter, and declining fertility. This soil crisis threatens food security, contributes to climate change, and undermines the ecological foundations of civilization.

This document explores the science of soil health, the principles of regenerative food systems, and pathways toward building soil-based resilience that can feed the world while healing the planet.
