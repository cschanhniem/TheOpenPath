# Energy Transition and Renewables

## Introduction

Energy is the foundation of modern civilization, powering everything from our homes and transportation to industrial processes and digital technologies. However, our current energy system, built primarily on fossil fuels, is the largest contributor to climate change and environmental degradation. The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas releases greenhouse gases, pollutes air and water, and depletes finite resources.

The transition to renewable energy represents one of the most critical transformations of our time—a shift from extractive, polluting energy sources to regenerative systems that work in harmony with natural cycles. This transition is not just about changing technologies; it's about reimagining our relationship with energy and creating systems that enhance rather than degrade the conditions for life on Earth.

This document explores the science and technology of renewable energy, the challenges and opportunities of energy transition, and pathways toward a clean, equitable, and sustainable energy future.
