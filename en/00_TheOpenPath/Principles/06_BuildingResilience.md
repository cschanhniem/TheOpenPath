# Building Resilience and Equanimity

## Introduction

Resilience is the capacity to navigate life's inevitable challenges with grace, learning, and growth. Equanimity is the quality of mental calmness and composure, especially in difficult situations. Together, these qualities enable us to remain stable and responsive rather than reactive when facing adversity.

This document explores the nature of resilience and equanimity, their importance for well-being, and practical approaches to developing these essential qualities.

## Understanding Resilience

### Types of Resilience
