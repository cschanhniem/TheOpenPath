# Developmental Milestones and Assessment

## Introduction

Understanding child development is essential for supporting children's growth and identifying when additional support may be needed. Developmental milestones are skills and behaviors that most children achieve by certain ages, serving as guideposts for typical development. However, it's crucial to remember that development is highly individual, and children reach milestones at their own pace within broad ranges.

This comprehensive guide provides detailed information about developmental milestones from birth through age eight, assessment approaches that honor individual differences, and guidance for supporting children's unique developmental journeys while recognizing when professional consultation may be helpful.
