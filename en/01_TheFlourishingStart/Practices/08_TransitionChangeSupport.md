# Transition and Change Support

## Introduction

Change is an inevitable part of life, and learning to navigate transitions successfully is a crucial life skill. For young children, transitions can be particularly challenging because their developing brains are still learning to manage uncertainty, regulate emotions, and adapt to new situations. However, with appropriate support, transitions can become opportunities for growth, resilience building, and skill development.

Transition support involves helping children understand, prepare for, and successfully navigate changes in their daily routines, environments, relationships, and life circumstances. This includes both predictable transitions (like moving from play to lunch) and unexpected changes (like a family move or new sibling).

This document provides comprehensive guidance for supporting children through various types of transitions, building their adaptability and resilience while maintaining emotional security and connection.

## Understanding Transitions in Early Childhood

### Why Transitions Are Challenging for Children
