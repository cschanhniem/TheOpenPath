# Nature-Based Early Learning

## Introduction

Nature is humanity's first and most enduring classroom. For millions of years, children have learned essential life skills through direct interaction with the natural world. Today, research confirms what indigenous cultures have always known: nature connection is fundamental to healthy child development across all domains—physical, cognitive, emotional, social, and spiritual.

Nature-based learning recognizes that children have an innate affinity for the natural world and learn best when they can explore, discover, and create in outdoor environments. This approach supports children's natural curiosity, builds environmental stewardship, and provides rich sensory experiences that cannot be replicated indoors.

This document provides comprehensive guidance for integrating nature-based learning into early childhood education, from simple outdoor activities to full forest school approaches, while honoring diverse cultural relationships with the natural world.
