# Trauma-Informed Caregiving

## Introduction

Trauma-informed caregiving recognizes that many children have experienced adverse events that can significantly impact their development, behavior, and ability to form relationships. Rather than asking "What's wrong with this child?" trauma-informed approaches ask "What happened to this child?" and "How can we help them heal and thrive?"

This approach is grounded in understanding how trauma affects the developing brain and nervous system, and how healing relationships and environments can support recovery and resilience. Trauma-informed caregiving benefits all children, not just those who have experienced obvious trauma, by creating safer, more responsive environments that support optimal development.

This document provides comprehensive guidance for understanding childhood trauma, recognizing its effects, and implementing trauma-informed practices that promote healing and resilience in early childhood settings.
