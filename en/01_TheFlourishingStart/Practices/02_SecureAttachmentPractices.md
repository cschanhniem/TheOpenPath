# Secure Attachment Practices

## Introduction

Secure attachment forms the foundation for all future relationships and emotional well-being. It develops through thousands of daily interactions between caregivers and children—moments of connection, comfort, and responsive care that build trust and emotional security.

This document provides practical, evidence-based strategies for building secure attachment relationships with children from birth through the early school years. These practices support children's emotional development, enhance their capacity for relationships, and create the secure base from which they can confidently explore their world.

## Understanding Attachment in Daily Life

### What Secure Attachment Looks Like

- Recovers from upsets with caregiver support

**In Preschoolers (3-5 years)**

### The Attachment Cycle

**1. Child has a need** (hunger, comfort, connection, play)
**2. Child expresses the need** (crying, reaching, calling, approaching)
**3. Caregiver notices and responds** (attends to, interprets, meets the need)
**4. Child feels satisfied and secure** (calms, smiles, returns to exploration)
**5. Trust and connection deepen** (attachment bond strengthens)

This cycle repeats thousands of times, building the child's internal sense of safety and worth.
