# Principles of Public Health

## Introduction

Public health is the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organized efforts of society. Unlike clinical medicine, which focuses primarily on treating individuals who are already ill, public health works at the population level to prevent disease and injury before they occur and to create conditions in which people can be healthy.

This document explores the core principles, frameworks, and approaches that guide effective public health practice. These principles have evolved over centuries of combating disease and promoting well-being, from early sanitation efforts to modern comprehensive health promotion. Understanding these foundations is essential for anyone seeking to contribute to improving health outcomes at community, national, or global levels.

## Core Principles of Public Health

### 1. Prevention

Preventing health problems before they occur is more effective and efficient than treating them after they develop:

- **Primary Prevention**: Preventing disease or injury before it occurs (e.g., vaccination, water treatment)
- **Secondary Prevention**: Early detection and intervention to minimize severity (e.g., screening programs)
- **Tertiary Prevention**: Managing established disease to reduce complications (e.g., rehabilitation)
- **Primordial Prevention**: Addressing the underlying societal conditions that lead to disease

### 2. Population Focus

Public health addresses the health of entire populations rather than individual patients:

- **Population-Wide Interventions**: Strategies that reach entire communities
- **High-Risk Approaches**: Targeting those at greatest risk for specific conditions
- **Population Health Impact**: Measuring success by changes in overall health statistics
- **Attention to Disparities**: Identifying and addressing differences in health outcomes between groups

### 3. Social Justice and Equity

Public health is fundamentally concerned with fairness in health outcomes:

- **Health Equity**: Striving for the highest level of health for all people
- **Social Determinants**: Addressing the conditions in which people live, learn, work, and play
- **Proportionate Universalism**: Universal actions with intensity proportionate to level of disadvantage
- **Participation**: Ensuring affected communities have voice in decisions
- **Rights-Based Approaches**: Framing health as a fundamental human right

### 4. Interdisciplinary Collaboration

Public health draws on knowledge and methods from multiple fields:

- **Diverse Expertise**: Incorporating epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health, social sciences, etc.
- **Intersectoral Action**: Working across government departments and sectors
- **Community Partnerships**: Collaborating with those directly affected by health issues
- **Global Cooperation**: Addressing health challenges that transcend national boundaries
- **One Health**: Recognizing the interconnection between human, animal, and environmental health

### 5. Evidence-Informed Practice

Public health actions should be based on the best available evidence:

- **Research Foundation**: Using scientific studies to guide interventions
- **Continuous Evaluation**: Assessing effectiveness and adjusting approaches
