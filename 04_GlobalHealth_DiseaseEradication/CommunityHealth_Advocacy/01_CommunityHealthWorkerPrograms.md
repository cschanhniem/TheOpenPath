# Community Health Worker Programs

## Introduction

Community Health Workers (CHWs) are frontline public health workers who are trusted members of the communities they serve. They bridge the gap between health systems and communities, particularly in settings where access to formal healthcare is limited. CHWs play a crucial role in disease prevention, health promotion, and connecting people to needed services.

This document explores the principles, models, and implementation approaches for effective CHW programs. Drawing from decades of global experience, it provides frameworks for designing, implementing, and sustaining CHW initiatives that can significantly improve health outcomes while empowering communities and strengthening health systems.

## Understanding Community Health Workers
