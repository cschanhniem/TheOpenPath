# Foundational Meditations

## Introduction

Meditation is a systematic approach to training the mind. Just as physical exercise strengthens the body, meditation strengthens our capacity for awareness, concentration, and emotional regulation. The practices in this document form the foundation of The Open Path and have been refined over thousands of years across contemplative traditions.

These practices are presented in a secular, accessible format while honoring their traditional roots. They are supported by a growing body of scientific research demonstrating their benefits for mental health, cognitive function, and overall well-being.

## Preparing for Practice

### Creating Supportive Conditions

Before beginning meditation practice, it's helpful to create conditions that support your efforts:

1. **Find a quiet space** where you won't be disturbed.
2. **Set a timer** so you don't need to check the clock.
3. **Silence notifications** on your devices.
4. **Consider the time of day** - many find early morning or evening most conducive to practice.
5. **Start with a realistic duration** - 5-10 minutes is enough for beginners.

### Posture

Your physical posture supports your mental state during meditation:

1. **Sit on a chair, cushion, or bench** - choose what works for your body.
2. **Keep your spine erect but not rigid** - imagine a string gently pulling upward from the crown of your head.
3. **Rest your hands** on your thighs or in your lap.
4. **Allow your shoulders to relax** down and back.
5. **Tuck your chin slightly** to lengthen the back of your neck.
6. **Close your eyes gently** or keep them slightly open with a soft gaze downward.

If sitting is uncomfortable, these practices can also be done lying down (though this may increase the tendency to become sleepy) or in a gentle walking posture.

### Attitude

The attitude you bring to practice is as important as the technique:

1. **Patience**: Progress in meditation unfolds gradually over time.
2. **Non-striving**: Paradoxically, trying too hard often hinders progress.
3. **Curiosity**: Approach your experience with interest rather than judgment.
4. **Kindness**: Be gentle with yourself when your mind wanders or you encounter difficulties.
5. **Persistence**: Regular practice, even when challenging, builds momentum.

## Practice 1: Breath Awareness

### Purpose

This foundational practice develops concentration and present-moment awareness by using the breath as an anchor for attention.

### Instructions

1. **Settle** into your meditation posture and take a few deeper breaths to transition into practice.

2. **Allow** your breathing to return to its natural rhythm - not controlling or changing it in any way.

3. **Direct** your attention to the sensations of breathing. You might focus on:
   - The feeling of air moving through your nostrils
   - The rising and falling of your chest or abdomen
   - The subtle sensations of the breath throughout your body

4. **Rest** your attention on these sensations, moment by moment.

5. **Notice** when your mind wanders from the breath (this will happen repeatedly - it's a normal part of the process).

6. **Gently** bring your attention back to the breath each time you notice it has wandered.

7. **Continue** this process of noticing when attention wanders and returning to the breath for the duration of your practice session.

### Common Challenges

1. **Mind wandering**: This is normal and part of the practice. The moment of noticing that your mind has wandered is a moment of awareness - a success, not a failure.

2. **Sleepiness**: If you find yourself becoming drowsy, you might try opening your eyes, sitting more upright, or taking a few deeper breaths.

3. **Restlessness**: If you feel fidgety or restless, try acknowledging these sensations with acceptance before gently returning to the breath.

4. **Boredom**: If the practice seems boring, try bringing more curiosity to the subtle details of the breathing experience.

### Variations

1. **Counting**: To stabilize attention, you might count breaths (1 to 10, then start over).

2. **Labeling**: Silently note "in" and "out" or "rising" and "falling" with each breath.

3. **Whole-body awareness**: Expand your attention to include the sensations of your whole body while breathing.

## Practice 2: Body Scan

### Purpose

This practice develops embodied awareness, helping us reconnect with physical sensations while cultivating concentration and relaxation.

### Instructions

1. **Begin** by sitting or lying down in a comfortable position.

2. **Bring** your awareness to the sensations of your body as a whole - the feeling of contact with the chair or floor, the weight of your body, the temperature.

3. **Gradually** narrow your focus to your feet. Notice any sensations present - tingling, pressure, temperature, or perhaps no sensation at all.

4. **Slowly** move your attention upward through your body, pausing to notice sensations in each area:
   - Feet and ankles
   - Lower legs and knees
   - Thighs and hips
   - Lower back and abdomen
   - Upper back and chest
   - Hands and arms
   - Shoulders and neck
   - Face and head

5. **Approach** each area with curiosity, simply noticing whatever sensations are present without trying to change them.

6. **If** your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the body part you were exploring.

7. **After** scanning the entire body, spend a few moments aware of your body as a whole.

### Common Challenges

1. **Discomfort**: If you encounter uncomfortable sensations, try to observe them with acceptance rather than resistance. If the discomfort is too intense, it's fine to adjust your position.

2. **Numbness or difficulty feeling sensations**: Some body areas may seem "blank." This is common, especially for beginners. Simply note this experience and continue.

3. **Strong emotions**: Physical sensations and emotions are closely linked. If emotions arise during the body scan, acknowledge them with kindness before returning to physical sensations.

### Variations

1. **Brief scan**: For a shorter practice, divide the body into larger sections.

2. **Tension and release**: Intentionally tense each muscle group slightly before relaxing it as you scan.

3. **Gratitude scan**: Bring an attitude of appreciation to each part of your body and its functions.

## Practice 3: Open Awareness

### Purpose

This practice develops a broader quality of awareness that can hold multiple experiences without becoming fixated on any particular object.

### Instructions

1. **Begin** with a few minutes of breath awareness to stabilize your attention.

2. **Gradually** expand your awareness to include other aspects of your experience:
   - Sounds in your environment
   - Physical sensations throughout your body
   - Emotions present in your experience
   - Thoughts passing through your mind

3. **Allow** your awareness to rest in an open, receptive state that notices whatever is most prominent in your experience moment by moment.

4. **Observe** how experiences arise, change, and pass away without clinging to pleasant experiences or resisting unpleasant ones.

5. **If** you find yourself getting caught up in a particular experience, gently recognize this and return to a more open, spacious awareness.

6. **Continue** resting in this open awareness for the remainder of your practice session.

### Common Challenges

1. **Getting lost in thought**: If you find yourself caught in thought streams, briefly return to the breath as an anchor before opening awareness again.

2. **Overwhelm**: If too many experiences feel overwhelming, narrow your focus temporarily to a single anchor like the breath.

3. **Dullness**: If your awareness becomes foggy or sleepy, try opening your eyes or bringing more interest to the changing nature of experience.

### Variations

1. **Choiceless awareness**: Allow attention to move naturally to whatever calls to it, without directing it in any way.

2. **Noting practice**: Silently label experiences as they arise ("hearing," "thinking," "feeling").

3. **Sound as support**: Use the soundscape as the primary field of awareness.

## Practice 4: Loving-Kindness Meditation

### Purpose

This practice cultivates qualities of goodwill, kindness, and compassion toward yourself and others, counteracting tendencies toward self-criticism and judgment.

### Instructions

1. **Sit** comfortably with a relaxed, upright posture.

2. **Begin** by bringing awareness to the area of your heart center, perhaps placing a hand there.

3. **Recall** a time when you felt loved, appreciated, or deeply at peace. Allow those feelings to arise naturally.

4. **Silently** repeat phrases that express well-wishing toward yourself:
   - "May I be safe and protected"
   - "May I be healthy and strong"
   - "May I be happy and peaceful"
   - "May I live with ease"

5. **Allow** the meaning of these words to resonate, connecting with the sincere wish for your own well-being.

6. **When** you feel ready, extend these wishes to others:
   - A benefactor or loved one: "May you be safe..."
   - A neutral person (someone you neither like nor dislike)
   - A difficult person (starting with someone mildly challenging)
   - All beings everywhere

7. **With each person or group**, repeat the phrases while holding them in your awareness.

### Common Challenges

1. **Self-criticism**: If you struggle to wish yourself well, try imagining how you would feel toward a beloved child or friend.

2. **Difficulty with certain people**: If strong aversion arises with particular individuals, return to yourself or an easier person before trying again.

3. **Feeling artificial**: The practice may feel mechanical at first. Continue with sincerity, and the feelings often develop naturally over time.

### Variations

1. **Single phrase**: Use just one phrase that resonates most strongly with you.

2. **Compassion focus**: Adapt the phrases to address suffering: "May you be free from suffering."

3. **Forgiveness practice**: Include phrases like "I forgive myself" or "I forgive you."

## Integrating Practice into Daily Life

Formal meditation practice is most effective when complemented by informal practice in daily life:

1. **Short pauses**: Take brief "mindfulness breaks" throughout your day to check in with your experience.

2. **Routine activities**: Choose one daily activity (brushing teeth, washing dishes) to do with full awareness.

3. **Transitions**: Use transitions between activities as mindfulness bells to return to awareness.

4. **STOP practice**: Several times daily, Stop, Take a breath, Observe your experience, and Proceed with awareness.

5. **Gratitude moments**: Take time each day to notice and appreciate positive aspects of your experience.

## Establishing a Sustainable Practice

To develop a lasting meditation practice:

1. **Start small**: 5-10 minutes daily is better than 30 minutes once a week.

2. **Be consistent**: Try to practice at the same time each day.

3. **Use reminders**: Set alarms or link practice to existing habits.

4. **Find community**: Consider joining a meditation group for support and guidance.

5. **Be patient**: Progress in meditation often happens gradually and sometimes imperceptibly.

6. **Reflect regularly**: Periodically review how your practice is developing and adjust as needed.
